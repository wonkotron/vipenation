History:
Many are updates or stright copies of the TD buildings I did for Tiberium Harvesting Sim (THS) projects around late 2022/early 2023. Mid 2025 I decided to finish the set and make the missing buildings and added buildings that TD and RA1 share from my RA1 buildings to complete all of the GDI and Nod TD buildings.

Update 7/2/25:
Made GDI yellow textures darker to better new TD GDI units I have made, changed the red texture of the Obelisk of Light to use TD_REF_Red_Hi.png. Orca, Apache and Harvester updated.

I don't care what you do with the models and/or textures. Make something cool or dumb with them I guess.
